<div>
	<p>
	In cricket, to decide if a batsman has been run out, the standard practice is to select the part of the image around the stumps and zoom on it so that the third umpire can take a decision. The region of interest is the crease. If one were to automate this process, several steps are required. This will include identifying the stump region and rotating the image so that the crease is at the right orientation and scale to enable an accurate judgement. 
	</p>
	<p>

	The set of transformations that will possibly be required are translation (to place the crease within the view window), rotation (to orient the crease such that the bat is seen to the left or right of it) and finally scaling so the bat position relative to the crease can be determined accurately.
	</p>
	<p>
	The set of transformations namely, translation, rotation, scale and shear (stretching in one direction) forms the affine class of transformations. In this experiment, we will study how the first three types of transformations are effected on a given image.
